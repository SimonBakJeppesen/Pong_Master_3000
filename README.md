# Pong_Master_3000
Reinforcement learning on a human-like throwing robot arm. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) methods.

**"training_notebook.ipynb":** The implementation of Proximal Policy Optimazation (PPO) agent for training the custom Gym environment 'RobotArm'.  <br />
**"robot_arm_gym.pi":** Custom Gym environment for a simulation of a human-like robotic arm.  <br />
**"trajectories.py":** Used to generate batches of trajectories for reinforcement learning.  <br />

Trained for 300 episodes:
